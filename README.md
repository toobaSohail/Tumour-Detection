## About Dataset

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

1) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3) perimeter
4) area
5) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
7) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9) symmetry
10) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
